<!-- If you have a difficult task give it to a lazy man ‚Äî he will find an easier way to do it.(paraphrase, Clarence Beicher) -->
>A curated list of Awesome procedural generation tools for art,music, titles, ideas and more. The purpose of generative tools is to promote peak efficiency. These tools are especially helpful for game developers, content creators, musicians and everyone else who enjoys creative play. If you love something, automate it and you never have to work a day in your life.
<!-- The arguemnt of quantity vs quality could be made about generative tools, but i digress because i believe to compete with other human beings a greater force must be used. Whether this force be simple scripts, algorithms, artificial intelligence or quantum computers. -->

<details><summary>üß† Q&A</summary>
 
 
 1. **Why did you create this repository?**
 - I couldn't contain my fascination with awesome lists on Github. I knew i had to contribute or create my own awesome list

2. **Why is your awesome list using a different name?**
- I wanted something sounded cooler. I know that i could have used something like Awesome generative tools, Awesome Procgen, Awesome procedural generation, awesome Procgen tools or awesome gen-tools, but all of them sound boring to me. Thats why i came up with Interplanetary Destinesia. Interplanetary because of IPFS and destinesia because the word is symbolic. Destinesia can best me summed as going somewhere only to forget why you were going there. That is symbolic with generative tools because you dont know what the tool will come up with. 
 
 3. **Are music generators that good?**
 - Yes, they really are. I couldnt believe myself, until i started playing around with them using LMMS and Soundtrap. Now i use Reaper and the time saved creating tracks is superb. 

4. **Whats a good indicator that a music generator is worthwhile?**
- The only way to tell if a music generator is worthwhile is when you see yourself using the physical midi keyboard or manually inputing notes into the piano roll. When you eliminiate the need to press keys or move your mouse you have reached procedurally generated enlightenment

5. **Out of all the music generator you listed which one would you say is the best?**
- I despise ranking, but AIVA would be have to be number one. Its even much better when you realize that the 3 free tracks per month for the free plan can be hacked by using multiple fake emails. If you have 10 emails thats 30 tracks right off the bat.

6. **Which music generator do you think ranks the lowest?**
- Out of all the ones that i have tested, Fake music generator ranks the lowest. Most of the composition sounds similar and have little to no variation. It excels at creating jazzy composition, but if they all sounds the same it stinks. Too much ragtime jazz can rag up your time

7. **Which music generator can actually create infinite composition?**
- Wolfram Tone Generator is the winner when it comes to this category because it can virtually create compositions of any genre. However each composition is limited to a maximux of 30 second and nothing more. Which is still awesome. If you are true music nerd or someone with musical literacy then Wolfram Tone Generator feels right at home

8. **Why do some people hate music generators?**
- Because they dont know any better, they dont believe in outsorcing the process. They would rather beat their brain into submission to produce music. When a person creates a song and it just so happens to go viral. Chances of creating even greater tracks should be linear, but thats the limitation of humanity that muusic generators overcome. To sum it up because they are offended by the angelic tunes that a music generator can concoct while they are stuck with music block

9. **Are any of these music generator a match for the ultimate procedural generation known as modular synthesis?**
- Modular synthesis is number one no doubt about that, i mean its the first instance of procedural generation in music to begin with. Music generators dont create new sounds, they simply create melodies. Modular synthesis can create new sounds and new melodies simulateneously, but our human ears can only harness that pleasure in small increments before the deafening effects slowly wane in. 

10. **Are art generators any good?**
- Music is mathematical, so its only natural that musical computation is possible, whereas art is not. When it comes to creativity that definitely requires some of rocket science jargon known as deep learning/machine learning. Art generators at the moment are limited to predefines mathematical geometry from isometric grids, fractal art and the wavy randomness. Simply put that with 3D the possibilities are currently greater than that of 2D. To answer this question it entirely depends on what exactly it is that you are looking for. 

11. **What exactly is the point of listing the so called human face generators?**
- Face generators are just straight up weird, but weirdly enough they do have some practical use cases. One could use them to secure their digital identity. I think it makes more sense for a game developer to use it in their project. They could easily pixelize them to create a pixel art game or as an NPC for 3D game. While not hyperrealistic, the element of fantasy is present without the need of being too conceptual. Or simply for some deep fake content

12. **Is Lyrebirds descript functional as they say it is?**
- I havent bothered testing it myself, but the videos seem convincing. Donating ones  voice for the enhancement of natural language processing....

13. **What got you interested in procedural generation?**
-

14. **Do you believe procedural generation is the future of content generation?**
